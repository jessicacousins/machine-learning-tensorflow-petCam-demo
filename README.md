# petCam Machine Learning TensorFlow.js Demo

## Description

This project is a practice exercise to understand the application Machine Learning (ML) using TensorFlow.js and Google's COCO-SSD model. The core functionality is built around a web application that utilizes a webcam to detect and recognize pets (cat or dog) and other objects.

## Dependencies:

`npm init -y`
`npm install @tensorflow/tfjs`
`npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli`
`npm install --global http-server`

## Features

- Webcam Integration: Utilizes the browser's webcam to capture real-time video feed.
- Object Detection: Employs Google's COCO-SSD model to identify and classify objects within the video feed.
- Customizable Alerts: Allows users to select specific pets and objects to monitor and receive alerts.

## Tech Stack

- TensorFlow.js: For running machine learning models in the browser.
- COCO-SSD Model: A pre-trained model by Google for object detection.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For the frontend development
